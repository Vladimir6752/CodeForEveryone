# CodeForEveryone
Pet project of the site's backend for writing and executing code directly in the browser in its own programming language.
<p>The code interpretation module is covered by more than 90% unit tests
The code is located on the server in the form of projects that are convenient to use from the browser. 
The code can also be written in different languages. The programming language itself is intended for the initial study of basic concepts. 
The project has a microservice architecture and will be deployed in docker containers on a remote server in the future.
At the moment, the project is under active development. Below are already implemented and tested sample lines of code:</p>


```
Число someVar = 15 ;
Число someVar = 20 ;
Число variable = 5 + someVar ;
Число threeVar = variable - someVar + 10 ;
Консоль threeVar ;
Консоль 10 + 15 + 20 ;
```
